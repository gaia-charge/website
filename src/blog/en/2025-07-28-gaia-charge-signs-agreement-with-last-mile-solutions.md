Gaia Charge is pleased to announce the signing of a bilateral roaming agreement with Last Mile Solutions, one of Europe’s leading providers of electric mobility solutions.

With over 240,000 operational charging points across 22 countries, Last Mile Solutions is a benchmark in the sector, offering intelligent charging management platforms that combine scalability, interoperability, and reliability.

This two-way agreement allows Gaia Charge users to access a pan-European charging network seamlessly, while LMS users will be able to charge at Gaia’s network. A collaboration in both directions — just as it should be in an ecosystem that aims to be truly connected and accessible.

> “Building interoperability is not just about technology; it’s about partnerships that put drivers first,” said Wojtek Siudzinski, CEO of Gaia Charge. “With Last Mile Solutions, we share a vision of an open, connected charging infrastructure that works for everyone.”

Gaia Charge continues to weave a broader, more integrated, and more useful network — for people and for the planet.

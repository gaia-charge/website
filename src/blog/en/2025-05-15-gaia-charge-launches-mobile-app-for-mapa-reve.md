Valencia-based company Gaia Charge has launched its brand-new mobile app to help electric vehicle (EV) drivers easily locate public charging points across Spain.

This app, independently developed by the Gaia Charge team, uses open data from the official MapaReve.es registry and offers a modern, streamlined experience focused on practical utility.

> “We know that charging can still be a frustrating experience for many EV drivers. We wanted to build something fast, simple and genuinely helpful—an app that makes it easy to find a compatible charger wherever you are,” said Wojtek Siudzinski, CEO of Gaia Charge.

## Key features:

- Search for public EV chargers across Spain
- Filter by power, connector type, payment method, price, and more
- View real-time availability
- Navigate directly with Google Maps, Apple Maps or Waze
- Fast and easy-to-use interface
The launch is part of Gaia Charge’s broader strategy to position itself as a leader in the EV sector—not only by operating its own infrastructure but also by improving access and transparency across the existing public charging network.

> “We want drivers not only to use our chargers, but to benefit from a network that works for everyone—even if the charging point isn’t operated by Gaia,” adds Siudzinski.

The app is now available for download on both Android and iOS:
